linked list is linear data structure like array and vector but there is ahuge difference in array and linkedlist 

in arrays alements are arranged in contigius manner like a lines of memory blockes which are before and forth to each other

fist node is called head 
last node is called tail  (in SLL there is no tal node )
the next ptr of the last node point to NULL


Inserton Logic

 3.1.1	Insertion
    Adding a node at the beginning of a linked list is performed in four steps.
    1. An empty node is created. It is empty in the sense that the program performing in
    sertion does not assign any values to the data members of the node (Figure 3.4a).
    2. The nodeâ€™s info member is initialized to a particular integer (Figure 3.4b).
    3. Because the node is being included at the front of the list, the next member becomes 
    a pointer to the first node on the list; that is, the current value of head (Figure 3.4c).
    4. The new node precedes all the nodes on the list, but this fact has to be reflected in 
    the value of head; otherwise, the new node is not accessible. Therefore, head is up
    dated to become the pointer to the new node (Figure 3.4d).
